    <h2>Current Engagements</h2>

    <h3>Instructional Aide for SI 206 - (Intermediate) Data-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>Started: January of 2019</p>
    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>
        I'm a member of the teaching team for a course that serves as continued programming education
        for informatics students; this is typically their secondary programming course and focuses on
        assorted skills and applications of Python while introducing SQL.
    </p>
    <p>
        Topic Include: Databasing (SQL, SQLite3), Web Scraping+Crawling, API's requiring keys and/or OAuth,
        continued exposure to Git for version control, and review of unit testing and 
        the principles of object-oriented programming (focusing on subclassing)
    </p>
    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I help students understand new concepts and troubleshoot their code.</p>
    <p>This mainly occurs in the weekly lectures (~140 students), in a lab section mentored by a
        Graduate-Student Instructor, and online via Piazza. I also provide grading.</p>

    <h3>Instructional Aide for SI 110 - Introduction to Information Studies</h3>
    <p>Started: January of 2019</p>
    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>
        I'm a member of the instruction team for an introductory course required for students pursuing
        admission to the BSI program; the course provides a very broad overview of the history, issues, and opportunities
        for professionals interested in the information/technology sector.
    </p>
    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
    <p>IA's for this course attend weekly staff meetings, mentor check-ins, and provide grading and student-feedback.</p>

    <h3>Residential Advisor - Stockwell Hall</h3>
    <p>Started: September of 2017</p>
    <p>Description:</p>    
    <p>
        After working in Residential Staff as a Community Center Assistant for the summer, I decided to interview
        for the chance to become a Residential Advisor the upcoming fall. I placed in Stockwell Hall for Junior year,
        decided to remain for the summer concurrent to my research internship, and ended up staying for Senior year as well.
    </p>
    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
    <p>
        An RA is never truly "off the clock." A large portion of the job is building community within the hall, as well as the
        building as a whole. Getting to know residents quickly and as well as possible is critical, but we also place an emphasis on
        ensuring a safe and respectful environment. We have weekly staff meetings, biweekly check-ins with our Hall Director,
        regular front-desk work shifts, and regular monthly on-call shifts.

        the front-offices of the Northwood Apartments
        This is a lame description but I'll think of something more exotic later
    </p>
    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
    <p>Managed building access, mostly by using a database to track thousands (tens-of-thousands?) of keys to
        university-owned appartments; Issued parking passes; Liaison with local maintenance contractors;

    <p>(paid) From September 2015 to September 2017</p>

    <p>Throughout my time at the University of Michigan, I've always shared my gift for written communication with others.
        I help other students with their essays, applications, cover letters, and resumes.
        While I still do this, I only consider it an employment state in my first two years of attendance, as I ceased
        charging students for this type of help when I had better job opportunities junior year. 
    </p>
    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
    <p>Error correction; Stylistic Feedback; Optimization under Word-Count Constraints; Organizational / Structural Criticism</p>
