            <p>My name is McCoy Doherty and I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Michigan.<br>
            I'm studying information systems with a concentration on information/data analytics<br>
            This website is a work-in-progress, being designed as part of SI 339.<br>
            A more polished version of the website will deploy to mccoy-doherty.tech later this winter</p>

            <p>
                <!-- Needs rewording to seem less salty -->
                <b>Motive:</b> In the course of filling out 150+ internship applications in a 3-week period,
                I began to realize the frequency of instances inwhich I felt frustrated with inability to
                express various points on online application forums; this website enables me to publish all
                that I wish to express, but made easily-accessible for prospective employers.<br>
                Even if they aren't sure they want to initiate a conversation yet, by exploring this 
                website, they'll ideally learn more about me than they would from a premade forum.
