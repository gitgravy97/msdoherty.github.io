        <ul>
            <li>Taken: Winter of 2017</li>
            <li>
                Reason: I was curious what the "School of Information" was all about, was curious about
                working with API's, and figured it'd be useful to learn Python.
            </li>
            <li>
                Learned: Basic Python Functionality, API Skills, Data Analysis Skills
            </li>
            <li>
                <!-- For this particular entry, duality of Learned V Skills does seem very redundant. -->
                <!-- Make decisions regarding this later. -->
                Skills: Python, API, Data Analysis
            </li>

        <li>SI 110: Introduction to Information Studies
        <ul>
            <li>Taken: Winter of 2017</li>
            <li>Reason: I was curious what the "School of Information" was all about and I'm also a history and social-studies geek,
                so in addition to being a program-application prerequisite course, it also just seemed really fascinating.
            </li>
            <li>
                Learned: A great deal about information history, modern issues in information science/studies,
                and both the opportunities within the BSI program and for its graduates. This would also be my first exposure to
                both social media and user-experience studies, topics that, while not my career emphasis, still greatly interest me.
            </li>

                experience or background working with.
            </li>
            <li>
                Learned: In addition to solidifying my understanding of unit testing and Git for version management,
                I learned a lot about databases, how to use API's that required OAuth or keys for access,
                and my favorite topic was easily web crawling+scraping.

                <ul>
                    <li>

    <h2>Currently Taking:</h2>
    <p>
        These courses combined seemed like a great opportunity to learn both front-end and back-end web development.
        In addition to wanting to learn how to build my own websites and applications, I also wanted to learn the foundations of
        JavaScript so I could learn the various frameworks (Angular, Meteor, Node, React, Vue, etc.).
        Also, as someone who really enjoys web-scraping, I think all of this web-systems knowledge could really be beneficial in 
        that respect as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to how course offerings, my academic standing, and graduation requirements interact, I cannot graduate until Winter of 2020,
        but do not have enough credit requisites to necessitate fulltime enrollment; rather than invest in unneeded credits, I've opted
        to continue my university experience as a "part-time" student, affording more time for both work and my independent learning efforts.
