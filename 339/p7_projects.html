    <h2>DPSS Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I collected ~2-3 years worth of public-disclosure data published by campus law enforcement.<br>
        I tagged incident reports based on crime type and location to understand what types of crime were most common on campus,
        as well as which dorms had the most incidents
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I've always been fascinated with law and crime. I've also been living on campus for most of my university experience.</p>
    <p><b>
        How:</b> Python used to collect data from API, mapped and reduced crime types due to variable naming conventions,
        Flask+Jinja2 used for making the application
    </p>
    <p><b>Experience:</b> Availability TBD</p>
    <p>Source Code: Availablility TBD</p>

    <h2>Michigan Cannabis Market Research</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I aggregated publicly-available data regarding dispensary product offerings and pricing for four Michigan localities:
        Ann Arbor, Bay City, East Lansing, and Flint. I used these aggregates too create the visualizations linked below.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I was applying to a student venture fund for the cannabis sector and curious about the Michigan cannabis market<br>
    In particular, product diversity of state-licensed vendors.</p>
    <p><b>Experience:</b> (Placeholder: Visualizations Intended to be Embedded)</p>
