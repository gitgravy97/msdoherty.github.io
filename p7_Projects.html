    <!-- I may have to refactor code to make embedding work out well-->
    <!-- Intent: Personal and class projects made available on this site-->
    <!-- Note: May need to refactor/rebuild code, reacquire data -->
    <!-- Aspects:
            1) Description of steps gone through in terms of implementation
            2) Embedding or linking out to project so users can interact with
            the applications / interactive visualizations
            3) Potentially upload source code to GitHub and link to it
