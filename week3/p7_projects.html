    <h2>DPSS Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I collected ~2-3 years worth of public-disclosure data published by campus law enforcement.<br>
        I tagged incident reports based on crime type and location to understand what types of crime were most common on campus,
        as well as which dorms had the most incident reports tagged to their building
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I've always been fascinated with law and crime. I've also been living on campus for most of my university experience.</p>
    <p><b>
        How:</b> Python used to collect data from API, mapped and reduced crime types due to variable naming conventions,
        Flask+Jinja2 used for making the application
    </p>
    <p><b>Experience:</b> Availability TBD</p>
    <p>Source Code: Availablility TBD</p>

    <h2>Michigan Cannabis Market Research</h2>
    <p>
        <b>What:</b> I aggregated publicly-available data regarding dispensary product offerings and pricing for four Michigan localities:
        Ann Arbor, Bay City, East Lansing, and Flint. I used these aggregates to create the visualizations linked below.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why:</b> I was applying to a student venture fund for the cannabis sector and curious about the Michigan cannabis market<br>
    In particular, product diversity of state-licensed vendors.</p>
    <p><b>Experience:</b> (note: currently linked, but later intending to embed the visuals)</p>
