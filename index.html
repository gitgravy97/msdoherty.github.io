    <p>My name is McCoy Doherty and I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Michigan.</p>
    <p>I'm studying information systems with a concentration on information/data analytics</p>
    <p>This website is a work-in-progress, being designed as part of SI 334.</p>
    <p>A more polished version of the website will deploy to mccoy-doherty.tech later this winter</p>
